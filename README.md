# PICO-AT Power Adapter
This board is a PICO-PSU to AT power adapter which also provides -5VDC.

## Intro
I designed this board for a small SBC that I could not fit a large power supply in the enclosure. This design is recommended for PICO-PSU units, and can be used with various retro motherboards that have the AT-style power connector. I have two versions in this repository, the normal version and a high current version. The high current version can be used with later model systems drawing more than 120 watts.
